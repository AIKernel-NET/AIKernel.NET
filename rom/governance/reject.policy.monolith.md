# Reject Policy Governance  
Version: 0.1.1-rc2  
ID: reject.policy.monolith  

The Reject Policy defines the canonical taxonomy of rejection reasons used across the governance system.  
It does not determine *when* a rejection occurs; that responsibility belongs to the councils and gates.  
This document provides a unified classification (RejectReasonKind) for all layers.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of the Reject Policy is to provide a single source of truth (SSoT) for rejection reason codes.  
These codes are used by:

- Councils (Logos, Ethos, Pathos) when casting Reject  
- Decision Gate when computing Deny  
- Trajectory Gate when computing Halt  

This ensures consistent auditability and deterministic replay across the system.

---

## 2. RejectReasonKind Taxonomy

Reject reasons are grouped by the layer that issues them.

---

### 2.1 Council-Level Reasons  
Issued **only** by councils when they cast a Reject vote.  
These reasons reflect *semantic* evaluation of the proposal.

- **SAFETY_VIOLATION**  
  The action introduces risk of harm or violates safety principles.  
  (Issued by Ethos)

- **LOGICAL_INCONSISTENCY**  
  The reasoning is contradictory, incomplete, or unverifiable.  
  (Issued by Logos)

- **CONTEXT_MISALIGNMENT**  
  The action violates user intent, emotional state, or contextual boundaries.  
  (Issued by Pathos)

- **IRREVERSIBLE_ACTION**  
  The action cannot be undone and lacks justification.  
  (Issued by Ethos)

- **INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION**  
  The proposal lacks required internal information.  
  (Issued by Logos or Pathos)

- **OPAQUE_REASONING**  
  The reasoning is not explainable or auditable.  
  (Issued by Logos or Ethos)

These reasons appear inside **CouncilDecisionTrace**.

---

### 2.2 Gate-Level Reasons  
Issued **only** by gates (Decision Gate / Trajectory Gate).  
These reasons reflect *structural* outcomes of the governance process.

- **ETHOS_VETO**  
  Ethos cast Reject, triggering absolute veto.  
  (Decision Gate only)

- **FAIL_CLOSED**  
  Approve votes did not reach majority (Approve < 2).  
  (Decision Gate only)

- **STEP_DENIED**  
  A step in the trajectory was denied.  
  (Trajectory Gate only)

- **IMPLICIT_DENY**  
  Default fallback when no specific reason applies.  
  (Used by both gates)

Gate-level reasons appear inside **GovernanceTrace** and **TrajectoryGateTrace**.

---

## 3. Canon Reference

Every rejection must include a **CanonReference** pointing to the specific section of the Canon or governance document that justifies the rejection.

Examples:

- `Canon.CTG.3.2` — Ethos veto  
- `Council.Logos.3` — Logical consistency  
- `Council.Pathos.4` — Contextual alignment  
- `Gate.Decision.3.2` — Majority rule  
- `Gate.Trajectory.3` — Short-circuit evaluation  

The reference must be precise and stable.

---

## 4. Layer Responsibilities (SoC)

This document does **not** define rejection conditions.  
Those are defined in:

- `council.logos.monolith.md`  
- `council.ethos.monolith.md`  
- `council.pathos.monolith.md`  
- `gate.decision.monolith.md`  
- `gate.trajectory.monolith.md`

Reject Policy defines **only the classification**, not the logic.

---

## 5. Determinism and Replay

RejectReasonKind must be:

- Deterministic  
- Layer-specific  
- Reproducible through governance trace replay  
- Stable across versions unless explicitly amended  

Identical inputs must always produce identical reason codes.

---

## 6. Amendments

This taxonomy may be extended in future versions of the Monolith-ROM.  
Extensions must preserve:

- Single Source of Truth (SSoT)  
- Strict separation of concerns (SoC)  
- Deterministic classification  
- Backward compatibility where possible
